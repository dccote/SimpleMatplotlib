# SimpleMatplotlib: Creating nice plots quickly with Python matplotlib

## Description
This is a very simple set of functions that are designed to be simple to use, not necessarily complete or very versatile. They are meant to be used by students to rapidly create a plot from data with a decent, sane, readable style.

This is borne out of a desire to help students and beginners who don't know Python, matplotlib or how to make a decent plot with their data. In most other libraries, the default values tend to be somewhat moronic: this is meant to help.

## Usage
There are three tasks that students need to perform with experimental data:
1) Read the data from a variety of formats
2) Plot the data
3) Fit the data

Currently, the package is empty but will address these three tasks.

## Contributions
Anyone is welcome to contribute modifications and initiate a Pull Request. I will evaluate.
